\textbf{Senior Research Project} \hfill \emph{Summer 2011 - Spring 2012}
	\begin{itemize} \itemsep -0pt
		\item Investigated collisions between particles each on 2-D random walks on lattice grid as a function of the initial number of particles, the number of steps taken, and the size of the grid.
	\end{itemize}

	%\textbf{Implementing Board Games with Pygame} \hfill \emph{Fall 2011 - Spring 2012}
%	\begin{tabular}{@{\hspace{3ex}}p{48em}}
%	Took well known board games and developed programs in Pygame that would enable users to play the game electronically, while allowing for as many of the same rules as possible. Succeeded in creating an interactive interface for Pokemon Master Trainer.
%\end{tabular}\\

%\textbf{General Purpose Chemical Equation Solver} \hfill \emph{Spring 2011}
%	\begin{tabular}{@{\hspace{3ex}}p{48em}}
%	Developed an interactive, general-purpose chemical equation solver that can balance and solve elementary, redox, and equilibrium reactions. The piece of software is now used by my instructor and his students to check their solutions whenever necessary. Created as a final project for my AP Chemistry course.
%\end{tabular}\\

 Also, responding to the general opinion (compiled through surveys) of CS majors at Caltech.

 \item Acted as a communicator between members on the team (a byproduct of effectively having to know everything that was going on with the development to create test cases).

 \item Setting up a service where interested individuals can volunteer their computer time to find a counterexample (or verify the result for very large values).


\item Automatic interpolation ("in-betweening") across noisy keyframes to produce animation that is faithful to the original drawings.
